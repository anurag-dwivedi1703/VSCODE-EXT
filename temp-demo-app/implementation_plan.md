# Implementation Plan - Change Button Color to Red

The goal is to change the button color from orange to red in the `index.html` file and verify the change.

## Proposed Changes

### `index.html`
- Modify the CSS rule for `button` to set `background-color` to `red`.
- Modify the CSS rule for `button:hover` to set `background-color` to `darkred`.

## Verification Plan
- Use `reload_browser()` to see the changes in the preview.
- Manually check if the button is red.
