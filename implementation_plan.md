# Implementation Plan - Project Explanation

## Goal
Explain the "Vibe Architect" VS Code extension project to the user based on the file system analysis.

## Steps
1.  **Analysis**:
    -   Review `package.json` for dependencies and scripts.
    -   Review `Project-Overview.md` for the high-level vision.
    -   Review `src/` structure to map vision to code.
    -   Review `webview-ui/` to understand the frontend.

2.  **Synthesis**:
    -   **Identity**: What is this project? (Vibe Architect, Agent Manager).
    -   **Vision**: What is it trying to achieve? (Antigravity replica, Agent-first dev).
    -   **Tech Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, React, Vite, Playwright, Gemini/Claude.
    -   **Key Mechanisms**:
        -   *Mission Control*: The UI hub.
        -   *Shadow Repository*: Git worktree isolation.
        -   *Self-Healing UI*: Browser automation + Visual regression.
    -   **Project Status**: v0.0.1, basic structure present.

3.  **Output**:
    -   Present the explanation clearly in the final response.
    -   Create `mission_summary.md` as per protocol.
